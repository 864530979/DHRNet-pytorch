# DHRNet-pytorch
This is the code implementation for DHRNet: A Dual-branch Hybrid Reinforcement Network for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images.

It is recommended to use GeoSeg（ https://github.com/WangLibo1995/GeoSeg ） for model training and prediction

For testing, we suggest using the eroded labels (Labels_all_noBoundary) along with 'd4' or 'lr' TTA for test.
